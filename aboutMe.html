            I have been studying computer science for over a year, I love how
            you can code and solve real-life problems. I have experience in QA
            automation, basic web development, and some game development, the
            next thing I want to focus on is Machine Learning. Some languages I
            have worked with are Python, JavaScript, and C#. The next language I
            plan on learning is C++. I am currently taking an Advanced Computer
            Science Course, where we have learned about GitHub, and Agile
            Methodology, and also made a few projects. The projects I have
            worked on are a Bot that auto buys a thing from Best Buy (Scalper
            Bot, I programmed that in JavaScript), the next thing I worked on
            was a Kahoot bot that joins 100s of bots to Kahoot live to test the
            user limit on Kahoot servers (also programmed in JavaScript). I have
            also made a basic website to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. Last but not
            least I have built a Quizlet live bot that adds 100s of bots to a
            Quizlet live game to test the user limit on Quizlet servers. I got
            into programming my sophomore year of high school where I have been
            coding and coming up with new project ideas ever since. It has been
            about 2 years, and I plan to go to PCC this year even though I am
            supposed to be a senior. Some of my previous job experience involved
            working in a covid center where I would talk to 500-1000 customers a
            day and give them instructions on how to use the covid testing kit.
            I was responsible for leading a team of 5 people to ensure the
            day-to-day operations went smoothly. I also worked at my uncle's
            restaurant where I helped with preparing meals. This strengthened my
            communication and leadership skills. I would love to work with your
            company as the skills I have and the skills I will learn will
            benefit both parties. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
